1. Applied DBM model to 3 datasets.
	a) valid/invalid/nochange/cue variables
	b) Event ('respEvent'), RA1 ('respRA1'), RA2 ('respRA2') logic
	c) No RT normalisation ('') and a (divide by subject mean-then-log) normalisation ('normDivideByMeanThenLog')
	c) Obtained plots that compared
		i) DBM 'r' with d'/cc-val/inv ('corr_pred') 
		ii) DBM 'r' with delta d'/cc-val/inv ('corr_pred...delta...')
		iii) delta DBM 'r' with delta d'/cc ('corr_pred-delta...delta...')
	d) DBM models are saved ('compareGridbest...')

2. Additional analysis for tACS dataset:
	a) Accuracy model. Here the correlation is taken between DBM predicted probability and accuracy instead of RT. ('Accuracy' is included in all related results)
	b) Subject choice repetition alternation model. A single variable of subject's choice repeating or not is modeled with DBM. ('choiceRA')
	c) DBM 'r' is found only for when the event occured (event=1) ('rForEvent1'). DBM model itself is the same but now r values will be different.
	d) DBM 'r' of valid variable is plotted against DBM 'r' of invalid variable ('corr_pred...invVal_DBMr'), only for Event based logic.
	e) Sequences of vectors are plotted against average DBM predicted probability of last trial in the sequence (1-predicted probability for RT models) ('gridbest_seq_effects...DBM_pred...').
	f) Sequences of vectors are plotted against average RT/accuracy of last trial in the sequence ('gridbest_seq_effects...RT...' or 'seq_effects').
	g) DBM 'r' is plotted in ascending order. ('RT_corr_compareGridbest')

3. Combined datasets: Obtained plots that compared
	i) DBM 'r' with d'/cc-val/inv ('corr_pred') 
	ii) DBM 'r' with delta d'/cc-val/inv ('corr_pred...delta...')
	iii) delta DBM 'r' with delta d'/cc ('corr_pred-delta...delta...')
	iv) DBM 'r' with average of d' valid and d' invalid ('corr_pred...avg...')
